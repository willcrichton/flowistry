# Information flow analysis

This crate contains the core analysis used by the [Flowistry](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry) IDE plugin. It is a Rust compiler plugin that computes the information flow within a function. The main analysis is at [`flowistry::infoflow::compute_flow`](https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/blob/master/crates/flowistry/src/infoflow/mod.rs).
